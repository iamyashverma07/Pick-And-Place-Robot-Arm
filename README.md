# Pick-And-Place-Robot-Arm<br>

This project involves the creation of a robotic arm controlled by an Arduino board and a smartphone application. The robotic arm is capable of multiple movements, including wrist roll, wrist pitch, elbow bend, shoulder rotation, waist rotation, and gripping objects.<br>

<b>Features</b<br>
<b>6 Degrees of Freedom:</b> The robotic arm can move in multiple directions, allowing for complex operations.<br>
<b>Smartphone Control:</b> Easily control the robotic arm using a custom-built Android application.<br>
<b>Bluetooth Communication: </b>The arm communicates with the smartphone via an HC-05 Bluetooth module.<br>
<b>Arduino Based:</b> Powered by an Arduino Uno, making it easy to program and modify.<br>
<b>Customizable Movements:</b> Save and run custom sequences of movements.<br>

<b>Components</b><br>
<b>Arduino Uno: </b>The brain of the robotic arm.<br>
<b>MG90S Servo Motors:</b> Six servo motors for various movements.<br>
<b>Waist</b><br>
<b>Shoulder</b><br>
<b>Elbow</b><br>
<b>Wrist Roll</b><br>
<b>Wrist Pitch</b><br>
<b>Gripper</b><br>
<b>HC-05 Bluetooth Module:</b> For communication between the Arduino and the smartphone.<br>
<b>5V External Power Source:</b> To power the servos.<br>
<b>Custom Android App:</b> Built using MIT App Inventor for controlling the arm.<br>

<b>Hardware Setup</b><br>
<b>Assemble the Robotic Arm:</b> Follow the instructions to assemble the arm and attach the servos.<br>
<b>Wiring:</b> Connect the servo motors and HC-05 Bluetooth module to the Arduino as per the wiring diagram.<br>
<b>Power Up:</b> Connect the 5V external power source to the servos.<br>

<b>Control Interface</b><br>
<b>Connect:</b> Establish a Bluetooth connection with the robotic arm.<br>
<b>Sliders:</b> Control each degree of freedom (Grip, Wrist Pitch, Wrist Roll, Elbow, Shoulder, Waist) using sliders.<br>
<b>Speed Control:</b> Adjust the speed of movements.<br>
<b>Save and Run:</b> Save custom positions and run them sequentially.<br>

<b>Usage</b><br>
<b>Power On:</b> Turn on the robotic arm and the Bluetooth module.<br>
<b>Connect:</b> Open the Android app and connect to the HC-05 module.<br>
<b>Control:</b> Use the sliders to control the robotic arm.<br>
<b>Save Positions:</b> Save specific positions if needed.<br>
<b>Run Sequence:</b> Run saved sequences for automated tasks.<br>
